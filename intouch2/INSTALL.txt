INSTALLATION
-------------------------------------------------------
For clean installation please read the instructions at 
http://www.claros.org/products/intouch/installation.html

Claros inTouch 2.0 is a brand new implementation of the webmail software
and it is not upgradable from previous releases. Apologies for this convenience. 

Installation : 

1. Have your MySQL DB installed on your system and create a new database called intouch.

mysqladmin -u root -p create intouch

2. Run the intouch-mysql.sql query in the SQL directory.

mysql -u root -p intouch < intouch2-xxx-mysql.sql

3. Copy intouch2.war into webapps directory on Tomcat
4. Start Tomcat
5. Edit the WEB-INF/config/config.xml file, follow the instructions. Do not forget to set the namespaces if your IMAP server uses one. Look at imap support.txt for more information. 
6. create a tmp directory and give read/write permissions to the user running tomcat. set this directory at config.xml Example: 

mkdir /tmp
chown tomcat:tomcat -R /tmp
chmod 777 -R /tmp (it is better if you do chmod 600 if you know what you are doing)
and edit the config.xml as : <tmp-dir>/tmp</tmp-dir>

7. Restart tomcat
8. You can reach intouch2 at http://localhost:8080/intouch2

PLEASE NOTE: You'll need at least 256MB of a heap size configuration at your JVM.
